DragonSRP
---------
This C++ library implements SRP6a protocol. The library is intended to be portable and modular
and easy to use.

The implementation is compliant with RFC2945 (The SRP Authentication and Key Exchange System).
Test program with test vectors is provided to ensure compliance.

Notes:
* The OpenSSL math functions can be easily exchanged 
  by creating a new class implementing the MathInterface.
  (You do not need explicitly OpenSSL.)

* The folder dsrp can be compiled without the -lssl flag.

* Examples are in the app folder.
